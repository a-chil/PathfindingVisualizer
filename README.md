# PathfindingVisualizer

Finding the most optimal path from starting point (start node) to destination (end node). The application uses the A* algorithm,
a common path search algorithm. More about the algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm

The application also allows the user to click and drag on empty cells to create walls. The algorithm will take into account the walls,
and generate the best path while not running into them.

A 'random' button is included, in which walls are placed randomly at 30% value.
